# Data Science Challenge

This repository contains my solution to a product classification challenge from the INF342 course at NTNU.

## Project Description

The goal was to classify product listings into categories based on noisy and incomplete text and numerical features. Techniques used include:

- Data cleaning and imputation
- Feature engineering with TF-IDF and NetworkX
- Text classification using MLP and XGBoost
- Ensemble learning and model evaluation with multiclass log loss

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- XGBoost
- NetworkX
- NLTK / spaCy
